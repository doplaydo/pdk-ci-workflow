The `hooks/` directory contains custom pre-commit hook scripts that are referenced by `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` at the repository root. These scripts are automatically installed and executed by the pre-commit framework when consuming repos point to this repository in their `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Each script should be a self-contained check that validates some aspect of repository compliance against our organisational standards — for example, verifying required files exist, ensuring fields match expected formats, or enforcing naming conventions. When adding a new hook, create the script in this directory and register it with a corresponding entry in `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`.
